  <div class="box-a">Almost 50,000 recipients of research-related PhDs, from 428 institutions, responded to the Doctorate Recipients from US Universities survey. The results were published in December. Recipients of professional degrees, such as doctorates in medicine or pharmacy, were not included.

Much of that gap can be explained by the outsized proportion of men in higher-paying fields such as mathematics and computer science, the two scientific fields offering the largest salaries, the census found. Men accounted for about 75% of doctoral degrees in those fields (a proportion that has barely changed since 2007), and expected to earn $113,000, compared with $99,000 for women.

Lower-paying disciplines showed more equity: in the social sciences, for example, men expected to earn $66,000, compared with $62,000 for women. Men didnt always come out on top: women in chemistry expected to earn $85,000, $5,000 more than their male counterparts. According to the census, about 75% of recipients in engineering are male, down slightly from 79% in 2007. In the lower-paid fields of psychology and the social sciences, women outnumbered men by 59% to 41%.</div>
