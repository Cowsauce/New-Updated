  <div class="box-a"> Elderly women are more likely to face poverty: 22% of women aged 65 and over are at risk of poverty compared to 16% of men. The smaller amount of money single mothers earn can cause malnourishment to occur in their children.Civil society groups organize awareness campaigns that include activities such as Equal Pay Day or the equal pay for equal work movement to increase the public attention received by the gender pay gap. For the same reason, various groups publish regular reports on the current state of gender pay differences. An example is the Global Gender Gap Report.. The report shows that the payoffs to work experience is lower for women across the world as compared to men. For example, in Venezuela, for each additional year of work, men's wages increase on average by 2.2 percent, compared to only 1.5 percent for women.</div>
